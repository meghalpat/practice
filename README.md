_In the canvas of azure high,
Where dreams and clouds entwine,
The sky unfolds its boundless tale,
A celestial realm divine._

Sunset hues, a fiery dance,
Painting whispers in the air,
Daylight yields to twilight's trance,
A celestial affair.

_Moonlit dreams on velvet cloak,
Starry verses softly rhyme,
Galaxies in silence spoke,
A cosmic, enchanting chime._

Wings of birds in graceful flight,
Trace the heavens with delight,
Sky, a tapestry of blue,
Unfurls its wonders, ever true.

_So gaze above with open eyes,
Marvel at the vast expanse,
For in the sky, a poem lies,
An eternal, cosmic dance._
